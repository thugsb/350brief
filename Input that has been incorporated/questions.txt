=== FAQ questions ===


>>> Why should the university `take sides' in this matter? Is it appropriate for the university to take stances on social and political issues?

In the university's: "As a general matter, the University does not take positions on social or political issues apart from those directly pertinent to higher education and academic research. Instead, its role is to provide a forum within which issues can be studied carefully and debated vigorously."

Generally, no
* In most cases, the U of T shareholder activism approach probably has a better chance of improving corporate behaviour
* This is an exceptional case, along the line of the tobacco and Apartheid precedents
* Link to 'why like tobacco'

The university has already taken sides
* Link to part in section 2

Permitting unmitigated climate change challenges the core values of the university

Divestment is justified here because governments have been so inactive, and are so comprehensively influenced by fossil fuel companies
* The benefits of weak climate regulations accrue to a few politically influential corporations, while the harm is spread out across everyone, which makes political organization harder


>>> Isn't shareholder activism a better option?

Fossil fuels are much like tobacco: the problem is the product itself

It's not reasonable to think U of T could approach companies like Shell and Exxon and convince them to stop digging up and burning fossil fuels

* http://gofossilfree.org/faq/

Also, climate change is too urgent
* Fossil fuel companies have worked hard to delay action on climate change



>>> Other people will buy the stocks we sell, so how does this make a difference?

Divestment has proven a successful strategy in the past, notably with tobacco and South African Apartheid
* Divestment campaigns have undermined the social license to operate of damaging companies

Divestment would signal that the 'smart money' is shifting away from fossil fuels. This could help produce a political climate in which significant action can be taken, including in the form of carbon pricing and reduced subsidies for fossil fuels.
* This also draws attention to the important 'carbon bubble' argument

>>> What are the University of Toronto's peer schools doing?

Fossil fuel divestment campaigns are ongoing at more than 300 schools across North America, including
* Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Duke, Caltech, the University of Michigan, Tufts, Wellesley
* The University of British Columbia, McGill, the University of Victoria, McMaster University
* Oxford

List successful referenda, motions from student governments, etc

Tufts:

This is an opportunity for U of T to show leadership


>>> But don't fossil fuel companies also invest in renewable energy?

Start with the 'Beyond Petroleum' story
* "In early April, Europe's second-largest energy company quietly announced that it was divesting of its wind power assets, part of what the company referred to as BP's "continuing effort to become a more focused oil and gas company and re-position the company for sustainable growth into the future." The decision followed BP's 2011 exit from solar power after 40 years in the business."

This is deliberate greenwashing
* How much they spend on advertising v. actual renewable investments

This is a small part of their total investment
* They are investing far more in unconventional fossil fuel reserves

The damage they have done so far with fossil fuels far exceeds the benefit from the limited investment they have made in renewables


>>> In what cases have courts found that fossil fuel companies caused injury?

Legal efforts by small island states

One example: https://www.sindark.com/2008/09/14/carbon-emissions-worse-than-criminal-damage/

Fossil fuel companies also cause injury in forms other than climate
* Oil spills - Deepwater Horizon
* Toxic air pollution - deaths from coal

This guy might be able to make some suggestions: http://www.law.columbia.edu/courses/L8451-advanced-climate-change-law/spring-2013/section-001
* Also: http://envirolaw.com/about/meet-dianne/


>>> Isn't the energy sector, including oil and gas extraction, production and distribution, highly regulated by government at all levels?

Not in terms of greenhouse gas pollution
* They can still use the atmosphere as a free dumping ground

The harm they are causing is dispersed, which makes it hard to assign responsibility, but we know there are major damaging impacts in the aggregate

Not only that, but many governments in Canada have been going out of their way to help the oil and gas industry grow
* Weakening environmental assessments
* Suppression of government science showing the damage
* Fossil fuel subsidies


>>> Can humanity manage without fossil fuels?

Summarize MacKay book

Efficiency

A transition away is inevitable


>>> Won't divestment hurt the endowment, including U of T's ability to provide scholarships?

Effect on returns
* "Major meta-studies by Deutsche Bank and Mercer have shown that a vast majority of academic studies of ESG investment performance have found either neutral or positive relationships between financial performance and the incorporation of ESG factors into portfolio management. Recent analyses specifically of fossil-fuel divestment have also shown minimal additional portfolio risk associated with excluding coal, oil and gas companies from passive index strategies."
* From 'Institutional Pathways'
* Carbon bubble argument

Quotes from Tom Steyer
* http://browndivestcoal.org/letter-from-tom-steyer/
* http://middleburycampus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SteyerLetter.pdf

Effect on portfolio diversity
* U of T already quite exposed to fossil fuel risk
* Canada's stock exchanges and financial institutions are heavily invested, which creates indirect risk for U of T

Also - link to the appropriate part of section 4

Specifically on scholarships
* The university expects to exist forever, so it needs to direct its endowment in ways that will remain sound over long timespans
* In the long term, the ability to provide scholarships depends on general financial health, which would be improved by divestment


>>> Won't fossil fuel companies stop making donations to U of T?

U of T doesn't receive very large donations from these companies
* Cameron will try to get more information
* Some donors listed: http://boundless.utoronto.ca/recognition/donor-listing/

The purpose of donations is at least partly to advertise, which would still be appealing to firms even if the school divests

Some schools that have divested have experienced an uptick in applications and donations


>>> Shouldn't U of T fight climate change through research and education?

The university is doing this, and will continue to do so, which is great
* But it is not a substitute for divestment

The very existence of the divestment policy shows that the university has accepted the basic argument that some investments can be incompatible with the values of the university

U of T would be showing leadership - divestment would draw major attention to the case for redirecting investment away from fossil fuels


>>> Won't divestment hurt Canadian jobs and the economy?

As it divests from fossil fuels, the university will be investing more in other, more sustainable sectors of the economy

Sources claiming that renewables create more jobs
* This is going to be a growth industry, as everyone gets serious about decarbonization
* Ontario is ahead of many jurisdictions on this, it is an area of comparative advantage
* U of T as an essential research institution within Ontario

In the long run, everyone needs to decarbonize
* Canada has further to go than most, given extremely high per-capita emissions
* Contraction and convergence

Total costs are minimized when spread across time
* Stern Review on benefits of early action
* Risk of tying up capital in fossil fuel infrastructure that cannot be used


>>> Won't carbon capture and storage (CCS) fix this problem?
