Removed from bibliography:

    author = "",
    title = "",
    url = "",

}



It would be great if someone could figure out the syntax cause of these errors:

===

Latex Error: ./divestBrief-skeleton.tex:79 Missing $ inserted.

Latex Error: ./divestBrief-skeleton.tex:80 Missing $ inserted.

Also, we should probably adjust the document formatting so that the heading levels are clearer, especially in section 5

One item in the bibliography is still rendering as just a period

Some institutional authors in the bibliography still render incorrectly, for instance: "International, DARA" and "wire, NBC News."

Having double-spacing for the bullet lists may be unneccesary, and make the document seem longer than it needs to
