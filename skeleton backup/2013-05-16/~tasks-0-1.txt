Divestment brief tasks

-Last updated by Milan on May 15, 2013

* Spell out acronyms and initialisms at the time of first use
* Provide full names at time of first use
* Use either %, or percent, or per cent in all places
* Put all dates in the format: July 5th 2005
* Use 'university' except when saying 'University of Toronto'
* Please use the Oxford comma: when listing facts, or figures, or anything else please put a comma before the last one.
* Please only put one space after a period
* In lists - if the items are complete sentences, put punctuation at the end. If not, do not put periods or other punctuation at the end
* Standardize abbreviation for kilowatt-hour (kWh)
* Fix remaining LaTeX errors
* Adjust the document formatting so that the heading levels are clearer, especially in section 5
* One item in the bibliography is still rendering as just a period
* Some institutional authors in the bibliography still render incorrectly, for instance: "International, DARA" and "wire, NBC News."
* Having double-spacing for the bullet lists may be unneccesary, and make the document seem longer than it needs to
* Go through the bibliography file to make sure everything is consistent - all items by the same author showing up together in rendered bibliography, dates and URLs properly formatted, etc
* 'arctic' does not need to be capitalized
