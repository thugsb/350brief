	\subsection{From the U of T divestment policy}



\begin{itquote}	
The University's core academic values include freedom of inquiry and open debate.
As a general matter, the University does not take positions on social or political issues apart from those directly pertinent to higher education and academic research. 
Instead, its role is to provide a forum within which issues can be studied carefully and debated vigorously. 
Given these values, the University will not consider any proposals for restrictions on its investments that require the institution to take sides in matters that are properly the subject of ongoing academic inquiry and debate.
\end{itquote}



	\subsection{It is not properly the subject of ongoing academic debate that}



\begin{itemize}
	\item The 10,000 years of human civilization have taken place during a span of relative climatic stability.\footnote{This claim is supported by evidence from ice core samples taken in Vostok, Antarctica as well as other proxy measures of climate such as pollen in lake sediments and tree rings.}\footcite[][p. 4]{Alley2000}
	\item Burning coal, oil, and gas produces known quantities of carbon dioxide (\ce{CO2}).\footcite[For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists quantities of \ce{CO2} produced by burning a barrel of oil, metric tonne of coal, or therm of natural gas:][]{CalculationsReferences}
	\item Before the industrial revolution, the concentration of \ce{CO2} in the atmosphere was approximately 280 parts per million (ppm).\footnote{Evidence for this includes the records of how much fossil fuel has been burned, as well as the changing isotopic ratio of carbon in the atmosphere.}\footcite[][]{IPCC4ARdrivers}
	\item It has now risen to over 390 ppm, largely because of the burning of fossil fuels.
	\item Humanity is now adding 31.6 billion tonnes of \ce{CO2} to the atmosphere annually, causing the atmospheric concentration to rise at a rate of approximately 2.0 ppm per year.\footcite[][]{RedrawingClimateEnergy} \footcite[][]{NOAATrends} \footcite[See also: ][]{FaustianGrowth}
	\item If humanity continues to burn fossil fuels at the present rate, the concentration of \ce{CO2} in the atmosphere will rise to well over 550 ppm by 2100.
	\item Adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere reduces the amount of energy the Earth radiates into space. This causes the planet to warm.\footcite[][]{IPCC4ARdrivers}
	\item Based on evidence from ice cores, we know that doubling the amount of \ce{CO2} in the atmosphere causes global temperatures to rise by about 3˚C.\footcite[][p. 473]{SafeOperatingSpace}
	\item Governments around the world, including the government of Canada, have adopted 2˚C as the threshold beyond which climate change should be considered `dangerous'.\footcite{CopenhagenAccord} \footcite[][p. 5]{CriticalDecade2013} \footcite[See also: ][p. 473]{SafeOperatingSpace}
	\item If the world is to avoid crossing the 2˚C limit, most of the world's remaining fossil fuels must be kept in the ground.\footcite[][]{IEA2012} \footcite[][]{EconomistUnburnable} \footcite[][]{TerrifyingNewMath} \footcite[The Australian government's Climate Commission states that most fossil fuels must be left in the ground and cannot be burned ][p. 5]{CriticalDecade2013} \footnote{For a detailed rebuttal of the argument that carbon capture and storage eliminates this necessity, see: \nameref{CCSSaves}.}
\end{itemize}

Comprehensive and authoritative scientific statements on the key elements of climate change date back at least to the 1979 U.S. National Academy of Sciences report (the Charney report).\footcite[][]{Charney1979}
The report concluded that human activities --- particularly greenhouse gas emissions --- were altering the climate in potentially dangerous ways. These conclusions have been subsequently re-affirmed in the four major reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990, 1995, 2001, and 2007.\footcite[][]{IPCC1990}\footcite[][]{IPCC1995}\footcite[][]{IPCC2001}\footcite[][]{IPCC2007}
In May 2009, the national science academies of the G8 countries plus Brazil, China, South Africa, and India released a remarkable joint statement.\footcite[][]{G8plusJointStatement}
The statement explains that: ``The need for urgent action to address climate change is now indisputable. For example, limiting global warming to 2°C would require a very rapid worldwide implementation of all currently available low carbon technologies''.
Among other things, it recommends that all governments ``adopt a long-term global goal and near-term emission reduction targets that will deliver an approximately 50\% reduction in global emissions from 1990 levels by 2050'' and ``collaborate in the implementation of low carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure and technologies, and in the implementation of innovative incentives, through the use of economic and regulatory instruments, to accelerate adoption of clean “green” technologies''.


Several significant studies have examined the state of the scientific consensus on climate change.
In 2004, Naomi Oreskes published a paper in \emph{Science} that quantified this.
She examined the abstracts from 928 peer-reviewed papers and found that all of them either take no position on climate change or endorse the consensus position.\footcite[][p. 1686]{Oreskes2004}
She concludes:
\begin{quote}
This analysis shows that scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed literature agree with IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and the public statements of their professional societies. Politicians, economists, journalists, and others may have the impression of confusion, disagreement, or discord among climate scientists, but that impression is incorrect.
\end{quote}
Oreskes' book \emph{Merchants of Doubt} elaborates on the article, discussing the strength of this consensus, while also providing details on the active campaigns of disinformation that fossil fuel companies have directed at decision-makers and the general public. \footcite[][]{MerchantsDoubt} \footcite[See also: ][]{ClimateCoverUp}
More recently, a study examined 11,944 climate-related abstracts from 1991 to 2011 and concluded that: ``[a]mong abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1\% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming''.\footcite[][]{QuantConsensus}


Mitigating climate change is important for allowing the university to achieve its academic mission. 
In the event that the world fails to curb greenhouse gas emissions and produces well over 2˚C of climate change, substantial damage is expected to be imposed on the global economy.
The Stern Review on the economics of climate change concluded that under a business-as-usual scenario, there is ``at least a 50\% risk of exceeding 5°C global average temperature change'' and that ``[s]uch changes would transform the physical geography of the world. A radical change in the physical geography of the world must have powerful implications for the human geography - where people live, and how they live their lives.''\footcite[][See long executive summary at: \url{http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/Executive_Summary.pdf}]{Stern2007}
Such an outcome threatens the growth prospects of the endowment and pension funds of the University of Toronto. 
It also creates additional geopolitical risks such as agricultural disruption and forced migration.



James Powell, former President of Oberlin, Franklin and Marshall, and Reed College, argues that university trustees have a quasi-legal duty to do all they can about climate change, arguing:
\begin{quotation}
``The board is supposed to make sure that the endowment allows for intergenerational equity, that the students who are going to Oberlin in 2075 get as much benefit from it as those there now. But with global warming, you’re guaranteeing a diminution of quality of life decades out."''
\end{quotation}
Taking action to address climate change is not an example of needlessly taking sides in a controversial issue. Rather, it is a matter of taking part in a necessary global transition. 
If the world fails to constrain the worst impacts of climate change, serious deleterious impacts can be expected for Canada and the University of Toronto.



	\subsection{The University of Toronto is already taking action on climate change}
	\label{UTTakenSides}

In response to the settled science of climate change, the university has already taken a number of actions motivated by concern about climate change and a desire to reduce the university's greenhouse gas pollution impact.
The university's actions show climate change to be ``directly pertinent to higher education and academic research''.


In November 2009, the University of Toronto signed the ``Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World'' pledge. In part, the pledge reads:
\begin{quote}
The Ontario university community is deeply aware of the challenges that face the world arising from climate change and the degradation of natural environments. Our universities accept this special responsibility on three scores: to assist in finding solutions to the challenges of environmental sustainability; to share knowledge about sustainability and climate change; and to incorporate, wherever possible, principles of sustainability into our own operations.\footcite[][]{OntarioPledge}
\end{quote}
The decision to divest from fossil fuels stocks would be wholly in keeping with these objectives.
Redirecting investment away from fossil fuels is a key part of solving the challenge of environmental sustainability.
Furthermore, by taking the lead and choosing to divest, the University of Toronto would send an important signal about how it views the future of energy.
This is also an opportunity to incorporate sustainability into university operations in a critical way, by having the university's values reflected in its stock portfolio.



\textbf{Policies and infrastructure decisions justified with reference to climate change}
\label{UofTActions}

The university has adopted an Environmental Protection Policy

\textbf{Academic programming}



In 2005, the university established a new Centre for Global Change Science (CGCS), which has since conducted exemplary research into climate change effects, as well as a wide array of public lectures focused around climate-related themes. The CGCS has hosted a number of talks as part of its Distinguished Lecture Series including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Successes and Challenges for Biodiversity Science: Distribution Responses to Climate Change --- James Clark, Duke University, September 18, 2012
	\item High Altitude Climate Change: The Survival Struggle of our Earth’s Alpine Glaciers --- Andrew Bush, University of Alberta, October 16, 2012 
	\item Assessing Vegetation Responses and Feedbacks to Climate Change --- John Gamon, University of Alberta, November 6, 2012
	\item Cumulative Carbon Emissions and the Climate Mitigation Challenge --- Damon Matthews, McGill University, February 5, 2013; and
	\item Trees to Tailpipes: Natural and Anthropogenic Influences on Global Atmospheric Composition --- Colette Heald Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, March 5, 2013.\footcite[][]{DistinguishedLecturer}
\end{itemize}



The university also offers courses on climate-change-related themes, including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Applied Climate Change
	\item Gaining Practical Skills for Climate Change Adaptation (UTSC Summer Institute 2013)
	\item Climate Change Law (LAW269H1S); and
	\item Climate Change and Human Health (CEM 406).
\end{itemize}
The University of Toronto also maintains an Environmental Research Database which includes ``430 University of Toronto researchers across all three U of T campuses engaged in environment-related research encompassing a wide spectrum of interests ranging from environmental finance to climate change''.\footcite[][]{UTEnvResDB}



Climate change is certainly an area of active scholarly research, but that research does not question the fundamental connection between burning fossil fuel and warming the planet. 
Nor does it challenge the argument that climate change is likely to cause a great deal of social injury and human suffering.
Rather, the academic work being conducted on climate change at U of T reinforces the case for divestment.



	\subsection{Fossil fuel companies acknowledge the reality and danger of climate change}


% Ideally, this section should be read while listening to Leonard Cohen's "Everybody knows"

	

Fossil fuel companies explicitly acknowledge that climate change poses a threat to the world at large, as well as to their operations and profitability.\footcite[][]{FFcorpsPlanning} \footcite[][]{OilCosFearFI} \footcite[][]{DemiseOfCrudeDenial} \footcite[][]{DoTheOpposite}
In their 2011 submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project, ExxonMobil acknowledged ``risks to society and ecosystems from rising greenhouse gas emissions''.\footcite[][]{ExxonCDP2011}
In the same document, ExxonMobil acknowledges that climate change may alter ``risks of weather extremes'' and states that they ``manage these risks through robust design and operations contingency planning''.
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations on June 27th 2012, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson stated: `` So I'm not disputing that increasing \ce{CO2} emissions in the atmosphere is going to have an impact. It'll have a warming impact.''\footcite[][]{Tillerson}
On their website, ConocoPhillips recognizes that: ``human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels, is contributing to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere that can lead to adverse changes in global climate''.\footcite[][]{ConocoPhillipsCC}
They also assert that ``effective climate change policy must... [r]esult in the stabilization of global GHG atmospheric concentrations at safe levels''.
On their global website, Shell says that: ``\ce{CO2} emissions must be reduced to avoid serious climate change''.\footcite[][]{ShellClimateChange} \footnote{Shell also has a climate change advisor, with a blog at: \url{http://blogs.shell.com/climatechange/}}
Chevron's website asserts that: ``a successful climate policy will be one in which the reduction of GHGs is accomplished equitably by the top emitting countries of the world through long-term and coordinated national frameworks''.\footcite[][]{}
On BP's website, they summarize the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and say that even with more aggressive GHG mitigation policies growth in \ce{CO2} emissions will ``probably not [be] enough to limit warming to no more than 2˚C''.\footcite[][]{BPClimateChange}
Entergy --- an S\&P 500 company with nearly 15,000 employees --- also acknowledges material risks from climate change.
Jeff Williams, director of climate consulting for Entergy, states: ``Clearly we are facing risks from sea level rise, more intense storms, flooding and surge damage''.\footcite[][]{ShiftToClimatePreparedness}


In numerous advertising campaigns, fossil fuel companies have acknowledged that climate change is taking place, and even that they bear some responsibility for dealing with it.



\begin{vcom}
There are lots of greenwashing ads - possibly even from Shell - that we can use to demonstrate that the fossil fuel industry itself acknowledges climate change.
\end{vcom}



When the University of Toronto decided to divest from tobacco companies, President David Naylor noted the significance of tobacco companies themselves acknowledging the health risks of smoking: ``that there is no serious academic or social debate about tobacco's health effects – even tobacco manufacturers by now concede them.''\footcite[][]{TStarSellOff}
