\textbf{How to use this brief}



This brief explains why divestment from fossil fuel companies is in keeping with the values of the university and why it is feasible and financially prudent.
This document is laid out to do three things:
\begin{itemize}
	\item respond directly to the University of Toronto's \nameref{PolicySocialPolitical} and \nameref{ProceduresResponding}, 
	\item provide a comprehensive and well-documented case supporting each major claim, 
	\item and give people the opportunity to understand the main elements of the argument quickly.
\end{itemize}
Those seeking a relatively quick overview should examine the \nameref{sec:ExecutiveSummary}, the table of contents, and the \nameref{sec:FAQ} provided.
Those seeking detailed information should read the entirety of the relevant section.



The petitioners who are supporting this proposal have affirmed that they have read and agree with this brief as a whole.
All errors that have been corrected since the brief was opened for signature are included in: \nameref{sec:Errata}.
